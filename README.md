### Hosted Link 
[Mouse Distance Tracker](https://tom-n-jerry.onrender.com)

### Project Description
It tracks how much your mouse has run, how much you made your mouse workout and exercise. The distance is measured in kilometres and a comparison is done to real life scenarios. Also has a colour customizable streaks that appear when the mouse is moved.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Let's find out if you're spending too much time in front of the screen and making the mouse hardwork.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
It's a mouse distance tracker which tracks how much distance the mouse has travelled, if it is more than a certain amount, it means you have to take a break from the screen and also give some rest to the mouse(let it also live in peace!).
